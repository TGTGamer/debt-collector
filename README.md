# Debt Collector

An action for keeping track of Technical Debt as it is created

### Current action:
  - Checks if Pull Request Comment contains descriptors for Technical Debt, if so it creates a GitHub Issue based on Technical Debt descriptors used, as outlined below

### Next up:

- Estimate descriptor. It would be nice (and scary) to see some relative level of effort pile up with the debt
- Aggregation of Technical Debt metrics and support for badging on repo, similar to Code Coverage badging, to enable keeping track of technical debt versus maintainable code at a glance

### Example usage

#### Pull Request Body / Comment

Your Pull Request Body / Comment must contain any required descriptors as outlined below, and any optional ones you wish to propagate to your Issue to be generated by the action:

**Important:** Descriptors and their content must be separated by at least one new line!

- [DEBT_ISSUE_TITLE] *(Required)* -- A title for the GitHub issue to be generated
- [DEBT_ISSUE_BODY] *(Optional)* -- A description for the GitHub issue to be generated

Here is an example of what a Pull Request Comment field that uses Debt Collector might look like:

> This pull request enables logging in with social accounts, however introduces technical debt due to requirements on how quickly we need to ship the feature.
>
> [DEBT_ISSUE_TITLE] Refactor logging in with social accounts
>
> [DEBT_ISSUE_BODY] Currently, the logic for logging in with social accounts is at the view layer in the app. It needs to be moved out into a helper class and we should utilize the ViewModel appropriately to give the View what it needs. Let's keep our views as dumb as possible for readability and maintainability.

This will automatically trigger creation of the Technical Debt Issue in GitHub that can be later utilized to fix the technical debt introduced by a particular PR.
